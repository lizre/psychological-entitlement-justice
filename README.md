<b>Abstract:</b>

What is the purpose of punishment? The current research shows that for entitled people—those with inflated self-worth—justice is about maintaining societal hierarchies. Entitled people more strongly hold self-enhancing values (power and achievement; Studies 1 and 3). They are also more likely, when thinking about justice for offenders, to adopt a hierarchy-based justice orientation: perceptions that crime threatens hierarchies, motives to restore those hierarchies, and support for retribution (Studies 2 and 3). Further, the relationship of entitlement to justice orientation is mediated by self-enhancing values when entitlement is measured (Study 3) and manipulated (Studies 4, 5 and 6). Together these studies suggest that entitlement—and the resultant preoccupation with one’s status—facilitates a view of justice as a hierarchy-based transaction: one where criminal offenders and their victims exchange power and status. These findings reveal the selfenhancing and hierarchy-focused nature of entitlement, as well as the roots of retribution in concerns about status, power, and hierarchies
